# Reconstruction
## Politics of Reconstruction
The reconstruction was
- The effort to restore the southern states back to the Union
- Redefine African American lives in the United States

These efforts began before the Civil War ended in 1863, when Lincoln saw that the end of the war was imminent and he saw the opportunity to stoke more Union support in the Confederate states. 

The Emancipation proclamation was committed to abolish slavery in the United States, but this did not free all slaves, just those in areas of rebellion, on top of that, approx 700k were left behind in bondage in several states such as:
- Delaware
- Kentucky
- Maryland
- Missouri
- Lousiana
- Tennessee
- Virginia

In Jan 31, 1865 the 13th Ammendment was passed which abolished slavery completely, except as a punishment for a crime. Section 2 of the Ammendment granted power to the Congress to enforce this article, State ratification followed and by the end of the year 3/4 of the states had approved the ammendment. 
When Lincoln was assassinated in April 14 1865 by John Wilkes Booth the Reconstruction changed, since Andrew Johnson took over and ratified the 13th Ammendment, repudiate the Confederate debt, etc.
